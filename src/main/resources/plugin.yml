permissions:

  ## Please note that Bukkit's SuperPerms is not supported, the permissions definitions bellow are merely informative

  letmein.disabled:
    description: |
      LetMeIn will ignore player connections when the player has this permission, the connection will be processed as if LetMeIn wasn't there.
      The player may still be kicked by an other player with letmein.kick permission,
      so you still need to give letmein.protected if you want to completely disable this plugin for him

  letmein.protected:
    description: A player with this permission will never be kicked to allow an other player to join

  letmein.kick:
    description: |
      When a player with this permission is near the head of the queue (value defined in allow-to-join-post config)
      a player without letmein.protected permission may be kicked to allow this player join quicker.
      The player is NOT randomly choosen, players without letmein.protected enters in a kick queue when they join the server
      this grants that only the longest sessions will be kicked. You can also define timed protection after the player join
      in the configs.

  letmein.staff:
    description: Allow a player to join when the server is full, skiping the queue and ignoring the server limits

  letmein.priority.1: # The number can be increased to give higher priority
    description: |
      By default the players have priority zero, if you assign a higher permission then the player will be
      able to skip players with lower priority in the queue. Increase the number to give higher permissions.
      The number must be between 1 and the max priority defined in the config, both numbers are inclusive.
